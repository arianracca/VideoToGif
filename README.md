# Welcome to Video to GIF

## Create your own gif from any video

1. Write the extension of the video you want to convert.
2. Write the name of the video file (without extension)
3. Write the path to save the file wherever you want.

I've noticed the GIF the program export is a bit large (1Mb for 1 second aprox).
Next step on my work will be make it smaller and add a cut scene where you can extract
just seconds from a video automatically.
